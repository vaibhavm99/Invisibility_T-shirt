# Invisibility_T-shirt
This is a project I made using OpenCV, where I made invisibility T-shirt. 
This is how I did it.  
STEP 1 : Capture the frame                                                    
STEP 2 : Convert the frames in HSV format                               
STEP 3 : Generate the mask for color of T-shirt  
STEP 4 : Using bitwise add, create foreground and background  
STEP 5 : Add them both and create the final frame and display it

This file displays the final video and also saves it in the same directory with name 'Output.avi'
